Matrix Object and Calculator

This semester, I'm taking Linear Algebra. I wanted to complement my understanding of the subject with my knowledge of computer science, so I decided to make a Matrix class in Java that allows me to perform matrix computations. This class is currently in development, but so far it has features of adding matrices, multiplying them, reducing them to echelon form, and reducing them to row echelon form. As the class gets more complex and I understand more about Linear algebra, I hope to add more features to it so that it becomes a more and more powerful matrix calculator.
